1. Declare and initialize variables for a person's name, age, and city.
2. Use an if statement to check if the person's age is greater than 18 If true, log a message saying they are an adult; otherwise, log a message saying they are a minor.
3. Create a function that takes three parameters (numbers) and returns their sum and diffrence
and Call the function with different arguments and log the result.
4. Use the modulus operator to find the remainder when dividing the person's age by 2.
5. Concatenate the person's name and city using the string concatenation operator.
6. Use a for loop to iterate from 1 to 5 and log the current iteration number.
7. Use a while loop to keep subtracting 5 from the person's age until it is less than 0, and log each result.
8. Create an array of three favorite colors, flowers, places, subjects and languages.
